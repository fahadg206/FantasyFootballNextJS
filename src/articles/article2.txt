WHO'S NERVOUS NOW?


YSL Big Yak

New Head of RCL Media Department

Dec 03, 2022

Looks like nothing is gonna get done around here unless I do it myself.

I’ll be taking over from here…


YSL GOT Y'ALL BIG NERVOUS! All those articles written by these so called “experts” that wrote me off, I heard the noise… “RL” vet is sitting atop this joke of a league and there’s nothing you media folks can do about. I'm not gonna lie, I got hit by a couple of key injuries, and to be honest if those injuries didn't happen ya'll would've been TOAST, believe me. Just Imagine Breece Hall added to the team I have...

Oh yeah my team organic too, all built from the draft! Everyone on my team has bought into the Big Yak Philosophy. What's that? Oh yeah Imma interview myself too... These mediocore reporters haven't done me justice all year. Who was my favorite win? It gotta be that fraud, Boogie Windhorst I made sure he gave up journaling for good after that Texas style WHOOPING. If he spent as much time building his team as he did writing these articles... he still probably would've lost cuz both are bad lets be honest. You write out paragraphs to send your message across, I get the same done with only one letter, we're not the same big feLLa.

Kabo, Boogie, Jefe… I had easy pickings on the whole RCL journalism department. 10-2 top of the league! RL!!!! This is for you!!! And sorry Sal, I was gonna say something to put you down but I don’t think you can possibly get any lower. Ah man those folks back in Redemption are gonna LOVE seeing you down there! They’ll even hook you up with some veteran RL discounts. Just make sure to tell em BIG YAK sent ya!
