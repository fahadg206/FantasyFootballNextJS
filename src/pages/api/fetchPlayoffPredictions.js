It is the first game of the season, and no games have been played yet. Write a witty and entertaining article titled "WAY TOO EARLY POWER RANKINGS" based on the provided league data. 
     Include all teams, each only once, with their playoff chances (percentage out of 100) and predicted record out of 14 games. Use confident, instinct-driven analysis with a touch of humor including jokes about their teamnames or players, 
      include their players in your analysis as well as which players you'll think will underperform or overachieve or even down right dismiss some teams from even having a chance to make it. The JSON response format should strictly adhere to the following structure:
