Everyone’s favorite legend might be on the move soon! Along with many other familiar faces.

According to a source close to Ganay’s camp, the organization is heavily involved in trade talks and are “Trying to get him shipped” to the highest bidder. Barring any unexpected buffs, the Harris Valley hero might be a tough sell due to his recent performances, but Ganay is sure that the change of scenery will help him play up to his potential.

Tensions are at an all time high between King K0bra and akhjefe as the two had to get physically separated after Sunday’s slate of games. “He’s gonna have something coming for him alright” JEFE told our reporters following Monday’s practice report, “He’s not even gonna know what hit him”. King K0bra has been on the fortunate side of Tua’s showing last week as he cruised to a convincing 2-0 start, when asked about the inevitable attention that comes with his recent wins King K0bra had this to say:

“Winning ain't easy, I just make it look easy… That fraud akhjefe can only wish to emulate my success, he tried mirroring me and where did that take him, exactly where he belongs. 0-2 carry the **** on”

Our RCL reporters caught wind of a developing 3 way trade that involves FG, Kabo and Ganay. This blockbuster trade has been deemed by our analysts as “League changing” as it’ll completely change the landscape of the league and how we play fantasy football. Some of the names brought up to the table have been Amon-ra st. Brown, Patrick Mahommes, Kyle Pitts, Dalvin Cook to name a few. This assortment of fantasy managers have been garnering some bad press however and regardless of how this deal shapes up the media will surely not take a liking to it, but they assure us that “everyone will walk away from this deal happy”.
